          or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors,
          I only disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing.

        <h5>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h5>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Right to data portability</h5>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand that I hand over any data I automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h5>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact me at any time.
        </p>
        
        <h5>Right to demand processing restrictions</h5>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may contact me at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, I will usually need some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that I restrict the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.
